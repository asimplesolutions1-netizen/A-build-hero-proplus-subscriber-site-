    <!-- Estimator & AI Material Suggestions -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Estimator & AI Material Suggestions</h2>
        <p>Planning a new home or renovating an existing one? Our new Project Estimator makes budgeting easy. Simply enter the size of your project and select whether you’re building new or remodeling — BuildHero calculates the estimated cost on the fly.</p>
        <p><em>Note:</em> The estimator uses average cost ranges from recent construction guides (e.g., $60–$110 per square foot for new builds【780073963948156†L215-L253】 and $15–$150 per square foot for remodels【553071745609814†L112-L124】). These figures provide a realistic starting point, but actual prices will vary by location, labour and material choices. For real‑time pricing and product images from retailers like Lowe’s or Home Depot, integrate with their APIs or suppliers to pull live data.</p>
        <p>For every project, BuildHero lists the materials you’ll need and recommends alternative options. Each suggestion comes with a sample image so you can visualise the look and quality of different materials.  The estimator now behaves like a shopping cart—quantities are pre‑filled based on your project size and can be edited, items can be removed, and a base cost, materials total and grand total update automatically.  This AI‑powered feature helps you choose the best products for your budget and style.</p>
