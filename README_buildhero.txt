BuildHero Package Contents

This package includes the following files:

1. buildhero_playbook.html - An interactive HTML e‑book styled as a community playbook. Open this
   file in your web browser to explore the content. In addition to tips, community wins and
   recommended product links (Lowe’s and Home Depot), the playbook now details BuildHero’s
   advanced project management, vendor & supply‑chain integration, mobile/offline capabilities,
   education resources and upcoming NovaDrop launch. (The credit‑builder features are reserved
   for a future release.)

2. buildhero_mascot_updated_final.png - The photorealistic BuildHero mascot (a lion with a yellow hard
   hat, blue BuildHero shirt and black hammer). Use this image in your dashboard, e‑book and
   marketing materials.

3. buildhero_dashboard_example.html - An enhanced HTML prototype for the BuildHero dashboard. It
   demonstrates stat cards for key metrics (payments, budget, mortgage balance, tasks, supply
   orders, vendor bids and change orders) and includes an animated mascot. Beyond the basic
   dashboard, the page now features a **Project Estimator** that functions like a shopping cart.
   Users can select a project type (new build or remodel), enter the size and see each material
   listed with its default quantity, unit price, subtotal and alternative options. Quantities
   can be edited on the fly and items can be removed; a base cost line shows labour and overhead
   costs (based on recent guides for construction and remodels【780073963948156†L215-L253】【553071745609814†L112-L124】).  As
   you adjust quantities, material subtotals and grand totals update automatically—just like
   checking out online.  Lumber, concrete, roofing and flooring costs use realistic averages (see
   `buildhero_dashboard_example.html`) and can be customised.  The estimator also provides sample
   images and alternative selections for each material.  A small audio player introduces the
   estimator—replace `mascot_voice_placeholder.wav` with a recording of your mascot to create a
   motivational voiceover.  For real-time pricing and product images from Lowe’s or Home Depot,
   integrate with their APIs or supply feeds; the current placeholders are only examples.

4. README_buildhero.txt - This file.

To preview the package contents, open the HTML files in your preferred browser.

Deploying on NovaDrop: BuildHero will soon be available on NovaDrop, your new digital platform for
homebuilding tools. Use the playbook’s “Launch on NovaDrop” section as a call to action and update
the placeholder link once your NovaDrop listing is live.

For integrating the dashboard example into a full project, you can copy the CSS and structure into
your React components and replace the static values with live data from your database. Connect
additional modules (e.g., budgeting, supply‑chain management, vendor bidding) to realise the full
feature set described in the playbook.
